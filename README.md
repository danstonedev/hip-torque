# IMU Hip Torque (Browser MVP)

## GitHub Pages
You can host this app on GitHub Pages. Steps:

1. In your repo settings, enable Pages and select the `main` branch with root (`/`).
2. Ensure `.nojekyll` exists at the repo root (present).
3. Wait for Pages to build, then open the provided URL.

Notes:
- The app is static and runs entirely client-side using Pyodide and Chart.js.
- Large CSVs run in-browser; performance depends on your machine.
